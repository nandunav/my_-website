     <p>This is me, Nandana Navaneeth. Am 10 years old and living in Bangalore. My hometown is Palakkad, Kerala and I speak Malayalam at home. My interests are art, dance, code, solving different rubix shapes (cube, traingle) etc. Am currently in 5th Grade and studying in Presidency School. If am not studying, do spend my time learning chess skills, create my own apps by coding using html,css and js.They are very intresting and also helps me to make website and many more!!Soving a rubix cube makes me think about the algorithms.I feel intresting while trying to solve the cube. I love to draw and color. When I feel bored I start drawing characters, sketch scenery and paint on canvas. I love to dance and currently learning Bhartanatyam since last 2 years and look to perform on stage. My new interest is music and have started learning so that I can sing and dance. Thats not it, I even like to read books!! and finally love to travel places, understand the local culture, try out different foods and enjoy the time spent along with family while traveling </p>
